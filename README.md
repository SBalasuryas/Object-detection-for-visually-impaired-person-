# Object Detection for Visually Impaired Persons

This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by recognizing objects in their immediate environment. Utilizing camera input and ultrasonic sensors, the system detects objects and provides feedback, enhancing the user's awareness and safety.

## Features

- **Camera-Based Object Detection**: Captures real-time images to identify objects in front of the user.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor Integration**: Measures the distance to nearby objects, aiding in obstacle detection.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Separate scripts for camera detection, image processing, and ultrasonic sensor functionality.

## Repository Structure

- `Camera_detection/`: Contains scripts related to real-time object detection using a camera.
- `Image detection/`: Includes code for processing and detecting objects in static images.
- `Ultra Sonic sensor code/`: Houses the implementation for distance measurement using ultrasonic sensors.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the project.
